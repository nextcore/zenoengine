# Release v0.4.0: Plugins Hot Reload 🔥

This release introduces the highly anticipated **Hot Reload** capability for WASM plugins, significantly improving the developer experience by allowing plugin updates without server restarts.

## 🚀 New Features

### Plugin Hot Reload
- **Runtime Updates**: Plugins can now be reloaded dynamically while the server is running.
- **CLI Command**: Added `zeno plugin reload <name>` (or reload all via `zeno plugin reload`).
- **Admin API**: New endpoint `POST /api/admin/plugins/reload` for programmatic control.

### Thread Safety
- **Concurrency**: `PluginManager` is now fully thread-safe using `RWMutex`, ensuring stability during concurrent API requests and reload operations.

## 🛠 Improvements
- **LoadedPlugin**: Added tracking of source paths to facilitate reloading.
- **Documentation**: Updated `WASM_PLUGIN_CLI.md` and walkthroughs.
- **Cleanup**: Removed experimental artifacts (C# Polyglot) to maintain core stability.

## 📦 Integrity
- Clean git state synced with `v0.4.0` tag.

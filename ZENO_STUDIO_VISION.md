# ZenoStudio Vision & Architecture

## The Concept: An Operating System for ZenoEngine

ZenoStudio is not just a dashboard—it is envisioned as a **Low-code/Pro-code Hybrid** platform that lives directly inside ZenoEngine. Think of it as a combination of Laravel Pulse, Supabase Studio, and n8n, designed specifically for the ZenoLang ecosystem.

Because ZenoLang is based on a pure Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), it is perfectly suited for visual programming. ZenoStudio will allow developers to build, monitor, and manage multi-app environments entirely from the browser, while still generating clean, readable `.zl` code under the hood.

## Core Pillars & Features

### 1. Visual Flow Builder (Node-Based Logic)
Instead of writing raw ZenoLang syntax, developers can build logic visually:
- **Canvas Interface:** Drag and drop nodes onto a canvas (e.g., HTTP requests, database queries, logic branches).
- **Node Connections:** Connect an `http.get` node to a `db.get` node, then pipe the output to a `view.blade` node.
- **Code Generation:** ZenoStudio automatically generates clean, valid ZenoLang code (`.zl` files) in real-time. Code generated by the visual builder can be edited manually, and manual code edits reflect back in the visual builder (bidirectional sync).

### 2. Database Studio
A built-in replacement for tools like phpMyAdmin, TablePlus, or DBeaver.
- **Visual Schema Builder:** Create tables, define columns, and set up relationships via an intuitive UI. Saving the schema automatically generates ZenoLang database migrations.
- **Data Browser:** View, filter, insert, update, and delete rows across all connected databases (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
- **Query Editor:** Write raw SQL or ZenoLang ORM queries and see the results instantly.

### 3. Live Blade & UI Editor
A browser-based IDE focused on frontend development.
- **Web Editor:** Integrated Monaco Editor (VS Code engine) for editing `.blade.zl` files.
- **Hot Reload Preview:** A split-screen view where editing the Blade template instantly updates the UI preview using ZenoEngine's built-in Live Reload.
- **Component Library:** Drag-and-drop pre-built UI components (forms, tables, alerts) directly into the Blade view.

### 4. Multi-App Orchestrator
Manage the unique "One Binary, Multiple Apps" architecture of ZenoEngine.
- **App Management:** Create a new app folder structure with one click (choose between Laravel-style, Domain-Driven Design, or Micro-App).
- **Virtual Hosting:** Map specific subdomains (e.g., `api.domain.com`) to specific app directories using visual routing tables (`http.host`).
- **Isolation Controls:** Manage `view.root` and `http.static` configurations for each app centrally.

### 5. Telemetry & Pulse Monitor
Keep a pulse on the health and performance of the engine.
- **Live Log Stream:** Watch ZenoEngine logs stream into the browser in real-time.
- **Performance Metrics:** Monitor memory usage, active goroutines, and requests-per-second.
- **Slow Query Detector:** Automatically flag database queries or ZenoLang slots that take too long to execute.
- **Exception Tracker:** Capture and inspect runtime errors and validation failures.

### 6. WASM Plugin Marketplace
Extend ZenoEngine without recompiling Go.
- **Local Registry:** Browse and install WebAssembly (`.wasm`) plugins.
- **1-Click Install:** Add new capabilities (e.g., image processing, AI integration, exotic database drivers) directly from the OS.
- **WASM Slot Manager:** Enable/disable specific WASM slots and configure their parameters.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

ZenoStudio will encompass its own multi-app paradigm within ZenoEngine:

1. **Frontend (The Studio UI):** Built with modern Web Technologies (Vue/React or Vanilla JS with Tailwind) served entirely by ZenoEngine's `http.static` and Blade slots.
2. **Backend (The Core API):** A specific `routes/api.zl` providing JSON endpoints to perform file system operations, DB introspection, and telemetry polling.
3. **Execution Sandbox:** The `meta.eval` and `meta.parse` slots run the code and validate AST safety before saving changes to disk.
4. **Zero-Config Deployment:** ZenoStudio is shipped inside the binary/source of ZenoEngine. Simply set an environment variable `ZENO_STUDIO_ENABLED=true` to access the dashboard at `/studio`.

## The End Goal

To make ZenoEngine the fastest fullstack web engine not only in **runtime execution**, but also in **development velocity**. ZenoStudio bridges the gap between no-code speed and pro-code flexibility.

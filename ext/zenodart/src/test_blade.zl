    // Variable scope inheritance handles $name and $items automatically if in same scope?
    // Zeno view usually isolates?
    // In ZenoDart, view creates child scope.
    // If variables are in current scope, child scope can see them!
    // So we don't strictly need to pass them in block if they are already defined.
